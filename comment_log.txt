commandline: hi
Sleeping for 10 seconds...
subreddit name: ronpaulcoin
commandline: A lot of the links that were on here didn't work so I removed them, sorry. Damn right about it being named after a Legend though.
commandline: Thank You for including RPC!
commandline: You all need to get yourself some Jesus!! lucky for us all the father almighty has granted us the heavenly gift of his currency Jesus Coin!! for which the debt of your Sins can be paid!!
commandline: write back when you've decided on whether you're in a crypto because you believe decentralized currency is the future or you're in it because you want to turn $1 into $1000
commandline: Answer: no.
commandline: This is just stupid
commandline: Please vote for RPC on mint everyone! ... 1 vote every hour! #336
https://www.mintpal.com/voting
commandline: Colin012, your always working the hardest on RPC ... I enjoy having you here with us!
just wanted to +1 you and say thanks again!
commandline: Thank you. This is what is needed. I suppose you don't want to share what your plan is or you would have already. I am eager to hear more!
commandline: I am not so sure about that. There are a lot of coins that see success despite being nothing new.
commandline: What really happened was the mega mutil pool which has too many hashes for new coin with relatively few regular miners hashing away at it. The difficulty change algorithm has once again been changed with the hopes of reducing mega multi pool's power over the RPC market.
commandline: Hmm. that isn't a bad idea.
commandline: Hey all. Its colin012 reporting in!
commandline: It's actually from January
commandline: Hey
commandline: I think one thing RonPaulCoin needs still is a clear goal and focus. Ron Paul likely wont run for president, so lets be clear this isn't an election campaign coin. Many people like Ron Paul, his politics, and his views. I think we should be real clear about how this coin relates to Ron Paul the man. 
commandline: this coin really isn't innovative at all. There's more valuable coins in comparison, not to  say that the other coins are that valuable to begin with...but surely more valuable than this coin.

I could only see it rising in value for novelty purposes tied to a current event. that's about it
commandline: I have some RPC saved. Weird that the mod is also mod of fedora coin and feels coin. I still think this coin could come back to life. Can we get someone to promote it in r/libertarians if there's such a sub?
commandline: What do you mean free market happened? Care to enlighten me? Also it looks like it was a pump and dump coin.
commandline: The free market happened.  It got hashed and sold into oblivion, and early investors are still holding with the hope of retiring with the profits.

God Bless 'Murika.
commandline: They add the top coin every 2 days,  keep voting! 
commandline: Not looking to active here eh?
commandline: Registered users are limited to 6 +1s an hour to use on different coins. Don't like those odds? Donate BTC to the listed address, each 0.00001 BTC in the balance is 1 vote. Unregistered users need to register an account before they can +1, BTC votes are not affected.
commandline: Nice! Where at? Vote for RPC on Crypto Rush: https://www.cryptorush.in/index.php?p=vote
commandline: This is dead. I moved onto to DogeCoins. 
commandline: Still mining away 
commandline: I sold, and am glad I did.
commandline: Hilarious?
commandline: They all left when they saw a /r/thepandacoin moderator was thinking of mining their coin.
commandline: Will he invest too ?

commandline: Likewise and also low decimal places. The political or meaning of the coin is totally irrelevant.
commandline: I'd like you all to know that RPC is one of the only coins that caught my attention. I don't even know why, it just did. RPC and Vertcoin are the only two that stand out. I'm from dogecoin btw. I think there's something attractive about the low number of coins, for RPC at least.
commandline: we should use RPC to fund causes that ron paul would support. like doge did with athletes and the guide dog charity, we should do for political stuff with rpc.
commandline: sounds like a great idea, just how could we actually do this?
commandline: Think there is any chance we could convince Ron, Rand, the Libertarian party, or any other Libertarian candidates to start accepting donations in RPC?

I think the biggest chance we have to get this to grow is to be able to post things like "Ron Paul is now accepting donations RonPaulCoin! If you'd like to support him but don't have money, you can now mine this coin using your computer and still make a difference!"
commandline: Just a prediction.
commandline: Id agree
commandline: The community needs to grow.  The adoption is dying.  Id sell or go long.
commandline: How about we for a non profit and setup an exchange.  The proceeds can fund libertarian candidates
commandline: Setup a Ron Paul family trust through Ron Paul Coin.  Have people donate funds. Funds eligible for Ron Paul and his son who is looking to run in 2016.  Or change the name to Rand Paul Coin.
commandline: Of course.
commandline: After cryptocurrencies go mainstream 
commandline: Without any uses or avenues to spend this coin it will just continue to lose value until it dies. I am pretty dissipointed in this coin so far. I have been holding out, betting that Ron Paul's popularity would stabilize its value, but if the community does not pull together some uses for this coin it will just evaporate into the electrons it is made from.
commandline: I have had 5 coins sitting in my crypsy account for a while now, they have done nothing but lose value. How and when do you think this will change?
commandline: He had his run and was scammed out of it. I doubt he'll try again now that he's retired. 
commandline: go Ron!!
commandline: I hope so.
commandline: You have some deep emotional issues man... You could have just said that his son might take a shot. 
commandline: If he runs in 2016, he'll be eighty years old. 

That's too old for it- and, chances are, his son'll be taking a shot at the nomination. He just needs to stand aside.
commandline: I'm sorry? 
commandline: The man's 78 years old, for fuck's sake. 

Let it go.
commandline: I want to give it to Ron Paul when he needs it 
commandline: Is there a reason behind this statement? Any whatsoever? Would like some substance please.
commandline: i think selling now will just be a loss. 

commandline: why?
commandline:  ^/u/KimDaebak ^asks ^randomness ^to ^decide ^luck ^of  ^/u/AlphaRocker ^and ^result ^is  __^mV97 ^milliVertcoins__&nbsp;^__($0.0325)__

commandline: I've always thought it would be cool to be able to donate RPC to his, his son's, or other related campaigns or fundraising efforts. Not everyone can donate part of their paycheck or donate time, but I'd be happy to donate some GPU power.
commandline: haha, I left muchhash for chunky about 2 days ago.  This was before I ever found this subreddit :)
commandline: It's sitting at about 0.021 BTC right now. I picked a few up.
commandline: How come the ping is so high? I live in the northeast i ping better to europe servers :/
commandline: Your making it sound as if RPC doesn't have value itself and being able to trade it for something gives it value. While this is true for cryptocurrencies in general in my opinion its not what RPC adds. While its cool to go on ebay and see how much my Ron Paul silver coin is worth I'm not trying to get shops to start accepting it for anything its not the point of it. Likewise if you want PMS buy it with BTC or fiat theres no point in having a direct transfer between RPC and PMS. 
commandline: I posted a thread on this in speculation on Bitcointalk.org

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=439565.0 Go show your support for his awesome view
commandline: This video is awesome everyone in crypto has to see it!
commandline: Setting up a shop where you could use RPC to buy 1 oz RP silver coins would be neat. 

Even just the ability to trade RPC for precious metals would be a huge plus!
commandline: It's more of a momento coin for people who appreciate Ron Paul. Like the reason I have a silver coin with his face on it.
People who like him can buy into this cryptocurrency giving it its value. I don't think trying to get it accepted by shops or online stores is a good avenue for this particular coin but rather more like a collectors/reserve cryptocurrency.
commandline: I'd say look for new candidates that embody Ron Pauls ideals, get the community to vote on one and then dump a bunch of RPC on them.

It's a good idea, you could generalize it even more with support projects that align with his political views.

commandline: I was using this pool it needs more hashes though! Spread the word!
commandline: We should just donate them to him in general. He deserves it.

 We need to get the difficulty up soon! Spread the word!
commandline: I've been using this pool, seems awesome. Check out the profit switching port (6666). Great way to spread out your cryptocurrency portfolio!
commandline: Thanks!!
commandline: Hi, where is this server located and what are the fees?
commandline: I think we will see some very high values come from RPC in the future. Just think-- it's only been out a month!
commandline: Ron Paul won't be running in 2016 but I think we could support Rand Paul in 2016 with RPC. It would bring some serious publicity. Plus Rand Paul is pretty BA too. 
commandline: Maybe we should fund Rand Paul 2016 with RPC instead.
commandline: What next election campaign?
commandline: On coinwarz.com you put in a few variables and it tries to estimate the most profitable coins for you to mine and your estimated revenue & profit. Pretty basic and doesn't adjust for upcomimg difficulty changes, but it'll give a decent look at things. Ron paul coin is currently #5 most profitable.
commandline: Dogecoin became viral, which is a very hard thing to try and replicate.

I think Ron Paul coin has a huge potential user base with noncryptocoin users. There are a lot of young Ron paul supporters who have heard about bitcoins and the like however had not had a good entry point. We should be finding those people. 
commandline: R9 270X
commandline: what's your equipment 
commandline: I'll check you out once my new cards come in.
commandline: Nice!
commandline: I found one in the UK that's pretty decent.  rpc.cryptocoinspool.co.uk.  About 40MH/s right now and 0% mining fee.  Come join!
commandline: I dont have rpc but I have kratom and want rpc in return
commandline: Let it be so!
commandline: Get off Muchhash. Find new pools people. Spread the power.
commandline: Chunky pool is where it's at. 
commandline: Just commenting here as a Dogecoin guy... I can't believe you guys actually got Ron Paul to talk about this coin. Lol. x3

But where do you go from here?
commandline: Coinedup has them...I am mining them but slowing going.
commandline: Fixed.
commandline: I can't login and password reset just goes to blank page...
commandline: The intrinsic value is now 27 almost doubling in a couple of days.
commandline: oh gosh you'll definitely need some luck :) 
commandline: I'd give him 10RPC just for the hell of it :P
commandline: The intrinsic value after has jumped from 15 to 21 since the news report.
commandline: I'm in
commandline: :)!
commandline: Lol so much excitement I spelled Approves wrong
commandline: Children, please. Windows and Mac each have their own special advantages. By the way, I'm on Linux, fools.
commandline: Got it! Thanks!
commandline: It would be very unusual if it didn't go down much further from here.  Coins often start off with high prices in their first few days of trading, before falling and then staying low a long time.  The reason for that is pretty simple, I think: At first there's some people interested in buying the new coin, but the supply on the markets is zero.  Then there starts to be a small supply, with anyone who's interested in the coin competing to buy that small supply.  Some demand + a very small supply = a high price.  But then the coins are usually programmed to continue steadily putting out a whole bunch of supply at the beginning of the coin, while interest may continue to grow but tends to grow at a slow and inconsistent rate (and also the first people who bought coins usually taper off their buying quickly, they don't usually buy continually at the same pace). 

Given the mediocre level of interest in this coin (there's lots of competition right now) I don't see how it could actually maintain a price above a millibit any time soon.  Sorry. :( 
commandline: You need to load the ronpaulcoin.conf file into app data folder, otherwise your wallet will have no nodes to connect (to download the blockchain)
Edit: grammar
commandline: Any of you guys load this up yet? I've been getting no block source. It's taking longer than when I started with Worldcoin.
to frequent
commandline: Still, if Ron decides he don't like it, the value of this goes down the turlet.
commandline: Some pools display that information, otherwise I'm not sure. [rpc.muchhash.com is the one I'm on, it displays it](http://rpc.muchhash.com/)

Right now it will be about 29 hours until it is changed (To about 8) at the current difficulty, or the developer forks it to adjust the difficulty retarget time, whichever comes first.
commandline: how do you tell how many more blocks untill the difficulty changes?

commandline: If the network is finishing blocks at the right time interval, it would be 1 day. Since the network is taking 10+ minutes, it will be several days instead.
commandline: from Chunky pool:
Network Info
Difficulty	80.06031858
Est Next Difficulty	14.84472888
Est. Avg. Time per Block	647.18 seconds
Current Block	12021
commandline: Actually video looks pretty amazing on my Retina display as compared to most Windows laptops
commandline: Same here. I just started mining and would like a mac client. I don't have the expertise to do this, but I have noticed that lots of coin clients out there start with a Windows version, then get ported to Mac. Since the Source of the original Litecoin client is publicly available, it can't be too difficult.
commandline: I'm wondering if Ron will adopt the idea of this coin, else it'll just be Coinye all over again.
commandline: yep i 've seen it go up to 0.0321 and down to 0.025 yesterday just after buying and deposing mined rpc. so it's bound to curve up steeply and not stay flat at now 0.0201, right?
commandline: Hi dude, im mining at 210khs, are you saying im going to win $2.8/day? And, how many time im going to keep this winning rate? Should i get a low or a high Mhs pool? Thanks a lot and sorry for my english.
commandline: Ah cool, I am mining at 1.4MH/s so about $20 a day or 0.5 RPC a day. Sounds good. I found out my GPU wasn't getting its ram allocated properly... So this also gave me he errors thus decreasing my hashrate.
commandline: looks like i am getting around a quarter of an RPC a day with 750 Khs and they are selling for .05 BTC. rough calculations at about $10 a day right now. you could round to $13/day per Khs. A 3Khs rig would put you at about a BTC a month. Not bad at all.

commandline: Looks like "thejackal" added the repository again..  hope it is legit!  
I have trouble to build on ubuntu however.  
commandline: I will mine for the day with 700 khs and let you know what i make
commandline: Ah! I gotcha. That makes sense.
commandline: No just as a Wallet.
commandline: Me too. Switched over mining from doge to rpc for today. fresh
commandline: What command are you running?
commandline: I use this pool and its great and freshhhhh
commandline: Still kind of new to this. Why do you mean? For mining? If so, why not use asteroid? 
commandline: I can't get my miner to open, when I click the cmd it opens the miner and shuts immediately. Any ideas? 
commandline: dont need them
commandline: Really different from all the standard pool's layouts... It's not like you're going to mistake this pool from others.
commandline: id like to agree, this is indeed fresh.
commandline: I feel like you are trolling me. Are you trolling me? Macs are renowned for video editing (Final Cut?), and are used in all kinds of professional studios. Besides, you said "video viewing" and there's fuckall difference in watching a video on a Mac.
commandline: there are more programs (especially to do with video editing etc) that are compatible with windows
commandline: hahaha, what are you even talking about?
commandline: i'm sorry about your video viewing =/
commandline: I'm really sorry about your life.
commandline: it is
commandline: What? I feel sorry for you if you think Windows is somehow superior to OSX.
commandline: despite escrows it's still better/safer to trade on a exchange...
commandline: with only 2.1m coins i dont think there are gonna be that much of faucets as we're used to with other coins..
but just imo
commandline: Awesome. I just signed up. 4000kh coming to your pool. 
commandline: just realized that.  Pool fee lowered to 1% and withdrawal fee set to 0.0001 RPC.
commandline: Rarity of coin does not mean anything as it's just number in bitcoin code you adjust and release new whatever coin. There's too much all kind of crap coins around and it takes just one hour to make new coin which has more scarcity than this. Only coins with strong infrastucture will succeed and there are not many alt coins with that attribute.
commandline: 2,100,000 total coins (to make it rare like gold which Ron Paul is a big supporter of)
1 coin per block for first 4 years. Halving reward every 4 years thereafter.
2 minutes per block.

...This coin is different. It's not a pump and dump coin.
commandline: How many more joke coins we need ?
commandline: Very good news. I wish sellers would let the coin go a bit higher though.
commandline: Will need promotion elsewhere, this sub only has 30 readers. 
commandline: Pretty good news!
commandline: SUCH RON

MUCH PAUL
commandline: Yes! I will donate .1 RPC to see this happen anyone else?
commandline: I have OSX and Ubuntu at home. Windows at work. 
commandline: 2014
not using windows
lel
commandline: >2014
>not using windows
commandline: I think the username of a moderator in a small crypto subreddit is the least of the coins worries. Cheers mate.
commandline: This is meant to be a more serious coin, right? I wasn't joking earlier. If you want a more successful coin, MY_ANUS_BURNS_ has got to go.
commandline: Cool
commandline: Ron Paul's PR team will have a hard time with this one.
commandline: You are excellent.
commandline: MY_SIDES_ACHE
commandline: I need a qt for OSX! 
commandline: :)
commandline: Sorry for going for the low hanging fruit.
commandline: It's a user name, it's not changing.
commandline: buncha fuckin stiffs in here
commandline: This pool is presently at 50+%, I believe....
commandline: Agreed, you need to change your name if you want help moderating. I'm here ready to go if you do.

Sorry, it's a PR thing. Marketing. Etc.
commandline: Naw I'm cool with my name.
commandline: I can help moderate, you should probably change your username btw
commandline: Is it hard to mine it with cpu?
If there is any coin i would like to mine this one is the one!
commandline: We need more pools to avoid forks and problems in the future.
Sleeping for 10 seconds...
